        <h2>Press Service - $1,800 USD</h2>
        <p>We craft tailored press campaigns to elevate the visibility of artists and labels within electronic music media and beyond. Our approach builds compelling narratives through strategic media placements, which can include interviews, exclusive editorial series, curated playlist takeovers, social media takeovers/appearances, travel guides, photo diaries, podcast guest spots, AMAs, studio/production-focused features, et al. With a deep understanding of the electronic music cultural landscape, we know which tastemakers, mediums, and platforms will amplify your music in a genuine way that resonates with your target audience.</p>

        <h2>DSP Promo Service - $750 USD</h2>
        <p>We pitch your release directly to our editorial contacts in the dance/electronic departments across Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, Deezer, and Soundcloud, significantly enhancing the standard backend pitching by distro, label, or management.</p>
        <p>Our DSP service also includes a bespoke third-party playlist placement and algorithmic playlist optimization campaign. We ask you for a list of ‘reference tracks’ from similar sized artists in your track’s micro niche, and pitch to curators who have placed these and similar tracks in their playlist. This targeted approach yields ‘high-quality listens’, tailoring your release’s algorithmic associations to improve subsequent algorithmic playlist placements.</p>

        <h2>Club/Tastemaker DJ Promo Service - $750 USD</h2>
        <p>Our DJ promo service ensures your release reaches key global tastemaker DJs, helping your music gain traction at festivals, clubs, and beyond. With strong relationships across the electronic music spectrum, we strategically place your track into the hands - or rather onto the USBs - of influential DJs, generating organic buzz via dancefloors across the world.</p>

        <h2>Radio Promo Service - $500 USD</h2>
        <p>We pitch your track for airplay across our network of international radio DJs and music programmers, spanning terrestrial, internet, and satellite stations.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we offer guest mix seeding, pitching stations on an exclusive guest mix (to be recorded after the station confirms interest), and/or syndicating one non-exclusive guest mix to stations and shows with recurring guest mix slots.</p>

        <h2>Policies</h2>

        <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>Due to the nature of our services, all campaign fees are non-refundable once the work has commenced. If a campaign must be altered or canceled prior to its start, we offer a partial refund, excluding any non-recoverable costs (e.g., platform fees, research costs) incurred during preparation.</p>
        <p>In instances where there is a failure to deliver on agreed-upon objectives due to unforeseen circumstances, we may offer a credit or discount toward future services at our discretion. If you believe there has been a significant issue or miscommunication with the service provided, we encourage you to contact customer service at bradley@braininavat.dance within 7 days of the campaign’s commencement in order to discuss appropriate next steps.</p>

        <h3>Delivery Policy</h3>
        <p>Once a service agreement is confirmed, we will initiate your campaign within 5 business days, unless otherwise specified. Throughout the campaign, we maintain clear and consistent communication to ensure you are informed about the status of your promotion.</p>
        <p>For services like DSP, DJ, and Radio Promo, results such as placements, mentions, or feature confirmations will be communicated to you as they occur. Please note that while we aim to maximize results based on our strategy and network, we cannot guarantee specific outcomes, as placement and editorial decisions are subject to external factors beyond our control.</p>
        <p>If delays are expected due to external issues (e.g., platform changes or unforeseen disruptions), you will be notified promptly, and we will take all necessary measures to mitigate any impact on your campaign.</p>

        <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>Campaigns can be canceled up to 48 hours before the start date for a full refund. If cancellation occurs after work has started but before major deliverables are provided, we may offer a partial refund, depending on the progress made and the costs incurred (see Refund Policy).</p>
        <p>For ongoing subscription-based services (such as retained services for multiple campaigns), you may cancel at any time before the start of the next billing cycle without incurring further charges. Any cancellations made mid-cycle will not be eligible for a refund for the remaining period of that cycle.</p>

        <h3>Return Policy</h3>
        <p>As a provider of digital and promotional services, our offerings are tailored to each individual client. Therefore, once services have been delivered or campaigns have begun, we cannot accept returns or exchanges.</p>
        <p>If you feel that our services did not meet the terms laid out in the service agreement, or if there are significant issues with the delivery of services, we encourage you to contact customer service at bradley@braininavat.dance within 7 days of the service completion. We will review your feedback and work with you to resolve the issue, which may involve corrective action, partial credits, or other goodwill solutions.</p>
